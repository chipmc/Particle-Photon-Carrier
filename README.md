# Particle-Photon-Carrier
EAGLE design files for the Particle Carrier

This is a project that implements a smart watering system for back-deck gardening.  I use the Particle platform
to moniror the soil moisture and the near-tearm weather forecast to amek intelligent decisions on when and how
much to water.  I have used this system on my own garden for the past three years and each year it gets a little better.

Please see the full project description and documentation (hardware and software) on Hackster.io.
